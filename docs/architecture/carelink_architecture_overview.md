# CareLink – High-Level Architecture Overview

CareLink is an elder support AI system built around **LLM agents**, **deterministic engines**, and **shared services**.

- Agents = autonomous reasoning and orchestration.
- Engines = domain analytics and signal processing.
- Skills = internal capabilities inside agents/engines (not standalone modules).
- Services = infrastructure utilities (APIs, storage, messaging, scheduling).

Core goals:
- Support physical health, mental/emotional wellbeing, cognition, social connectedness, and daily independence.
- Provide a single, empathetic conversational interface for older adults.
- Act as a smart early-warning and “safety net” without pretending to replace doctors or caregivers.
