# CareLink – Elder Support AI System

This package contains architecture and specification files for **CareLink**, an elder support AI system.
All documents are designed to be used as **context for Cursor** (e.g. `architecture.md`, `context/` files).

## Files

- `carelink_architecture_overview.md` – high-level description of CareLink.
- `carelink_agents.md` – detailed specification of all agents.
- `carelink_engines.md` – specification of engines and internal skills.
- `carelink_services.md` – infrastructure and language services.
- `carelink_api_contracts.md` – API contracts and event interfaces.
- `carelink_system_spec_cursor_ready.md` – unified, unambiguous spec (master doc).
- `carelink_architecture.mmd` – Mermaid diagram of the architecture.
- `carelink_components.json` – machine-readable component model.
- `carelink_components.yaml` – same as JSON, in YAML form.

You can:
- Use `carelink_system_spec_cursor_ready.md` as a single source of truth.
- Or include the more granular `*agents/engines/services/api*.md` files as separate contexts for different workspaces.
